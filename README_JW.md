# Future of Coffee Distribution
### Jim Wynne, Morgan Scafidi, Shane Jepson

Climate change will greatly alter growing conditions for the world's favorite drug: coffee. Changing weather patterns, temperature, natural disasters and more will devastate current growing zones and shift where our beloved stimulant will come from. This project seeks to map the effects of the shifting climate on the distribution of coffee around the world using satellite climate data.
